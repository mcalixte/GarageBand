## Instructions and Warnings

*Warning*: This project has been implemented and tested using IntelliJ therefore it is recommended to use IntelliJ

*Warning*: This is a java project so java must be part of the users environment

*Warning*: Please Mark Directory as... Test Sources Folder (src/test/java).

1. Open your IDE and import the repository as a Maven Project. On IntelliJ, you can also press on the "Check out from Version Control" and it will prompt you for the repository URL. This URL can be found under the "Clone or Download" button of the Github page. Wait until the project has fully downloaded before continuing.

2. Once the repository is imported, the project directory window will display the directory of all the files related to GarageBand, which will most likely be found on the left side of the IDE. From there, the file called GarageManagementSystemApplication.java can be found by following the path:

> SOEN343 [garage-management-system] > src > main > java > com.soen343.gms > GarageManagementSystemApplication.java

3. Now right click GarageManagementSystemApplication.java and run it

4. Go to a web browser and type in localhost:8080 and from there you should have access to Garage Band.
